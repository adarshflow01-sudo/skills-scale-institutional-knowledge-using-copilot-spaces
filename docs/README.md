# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

This repository centralizes the project management knowledge and workflows used by OctoAcme, helping teams execute projects consistently, accelerate onboarding, and reduce operational risk.

## Overview

OctoAcme’s project management framework is built around transparency, clear roles, iterative delivery, and continuous improvement. Projects begin with a formal initiation phase, using lightweight one-pager templates to define business needs, outcomes, stakeholders, metrics, and risks. After stakeholder alignment and approval, planning organizes work into actionable backlog items, estimates effort, defines milestones, and sets clear acceptance criteria for deliverables.

Project execution is tracked via project boards, daily standups, weekly syncs, and milestone reviews. Distinct personas—Project Managers (schedules, tracking, communication), Product Managers (vision, priorities, metrics), Developers (feature delivery, testing), QA (quality verification), and Stakeholders (input, approvals)—ensure clear ownership and collaboration at every stage.

Quality assurance is embedded throughout: automated unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, CI checks, manual QA as needed, release checklists, and rollback protocols. Blockers and risks are escalated via defined paths from team triage up to sponsors, and all incidents receive blameless retrospective analysis.

Communication is structured and proactive, using templates for status updates, incident reports, and stakeholder briefings. Risks, dependencies, and improvement action items are tracked, reviewed, and incorporated in regular retrospectives—feeding a culture of continuous improvement and responsiveness to team and stakeholder needs.
